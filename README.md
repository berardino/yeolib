# YeoLibrary

YeoLibrary is a small library that aims to facilitate the prototyping of algorithms and the implementation of demo applications in the field of the virtual reality.
The scope of this library is to provide a simple api that integrates and abstracts from specific vendor api of haptic devices, computer graphics, VR headset, audio etc...

We are not aiming to implement, yet, another 3D engine. Writing one is not simple and there are already quite a few available.

Our mission is to provide a simple but flexible api tailored
for laboratories and reasearchs who don't want to spend time studying computer graphics api and so on, but are looking for a simple way for testing their algorithms and fast prototyping their demo applications.
